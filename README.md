# Context
Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similar (or the same) questions. Various questions with the same intent can cause people to spend extra time searching for the best answer to their question, and results in members answering multiple versions of the same question. Quora uses random forest to identify duplicated questions to provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.

# Description

The goal of this project is to identify duplicate questions in a dataset provided by Quora. This dataset  was labeled by human experts which is an expensive process. The model built will automatically identify and label duplicate questions.

### Data
